# R Programming Concepts

Materials for R Programming Concepts for Complete Beginners Workshop

This workshop is for those who are new R users and new to programming.  We cover the following concepts within the context of R:

* R vs. RStudio
* Terms: Consoles, GUIs, IDEs, etc.
* Interactive coding vs. scripts 
* Data Types & Boolean Operators
* Variables: how does R store values and data sets
* Vectors and indexing: how to reference individual observations or subset a list of values
* Functions: calling them, arguments and parameters, return values
* File paths, File types: how to read your data files
* Data files


Some of these ideas are covered again in our multi-day introductory R workshops, but they are covered there at a faster pace without explaining the underlying concepts at the same level of depth.
