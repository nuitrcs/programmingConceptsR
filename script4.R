# TRY IT ----

# This code creates two vectors with random values.
# Run the code and look at the vectors
v1 <- rnorm(20)
v2 <- rnorm(20)

# Which vector has the greater mean?


# Which vector has the greater variance?


# Which vector has the greater max value?  max() is the function



# What is this code doing?
max(v1, v2)


# Challenge: run the expression below to open the documentation for the max function.
# See if you can figure out how to get the pairwise maximum values for each 
# position in the v1 and v2 vectors: the output should have 20 values
?max
